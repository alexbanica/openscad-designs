# OpenSCAD Designs

This repository contains editable OpenSCAD designs. The current primary design is a Raspberry Pi 5 AI HAT+ dual-heatsink vision case: a printable open tower frame with a forward camera arm, adjustable tilt holder, bottom intake, top exhaust opening, and CSI ribbon relief.

## Design File

- `rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad`

The file targets OpenSCAD 2021.01 and has no external library dependencies.

## Component Assumptions

Default dimensions are configurable at the top of the `.scad` file. The initial defaults assume:

- Raspberry Pi 5 board: 85 mm x 56 mm.
- Raspberry Pi AI HAT+ or compatible HAT footprint: about 66 mm x 56.5 mm.
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module 3 Standard: 25 mm x 24 mm x 11.5 mm envelope.
- Common M2.5 Raspberry Pi mounting hardware.
- A Pi active cooler below the HAT and a second active cooler above the AI HAT.

The cooler models are clearance volumes for fit and airflow inspection, not vendor-accurate cosmetic models.

## Adjustable Parameters

The OpenSCAD source starts with an `Adjustable Parameters` section grouped by:

- render controls,
- board dimensions,
- stack and cooler clearances,
- case structure,
- ventilation,
- camera system,
- CSI ribbon routing,
- fasteners and print tolerances.

Common edits:

- Change `render_mode` to export a specific printable part.
- Set `show_electronics = false` for printable-only previews.
- Adjust `camera_arm_forward_offset_mm` and `camera_tilt_angle_deg` for camera placement.
- Increase `case_board_clearance_mm`, `fit_tolerance_mm`, or `layer_friendly_clearance_mm` for looser prints.
- Adjust cooler clearance heights if a specific heatsink or fan stack is taller than the defaults.

## Render Modes

Set `render_mode` to one of:

- `assembly`: full preview with tower, camera arm, holder, and optional electronics.
- `tower`: tower/base printable part.
- `camera_arm`: forward camera arm printable part.
- `camera_holder`: camera holder and tilt hinge printable part.
- `printable_layout`: printable parts arranged side-by-side for inspection.

Example export command:

```sh
openscad -o tower.stl -D 'render_mode="tower"' rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad
```

For inspection with electronics hidden:

```sh
openscad -o assembly.off -D 'render_mode="assembly"' -D 'show_electronics=false' rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad
```

## Bambu Lab Print Notes

- Print tower, camera arm, and holder as separate parts.
- Use PLA, PETG, or another material appropriate for the target thermal environment.
- Prefer at least three perimeters for the tower posts and camera hinge.
- Orient the tower on the base plate, the arm flat on its broad face, and the camera holder with the back face on the bed.
- Use normal supports only if your slicer flags the camera hinge or holder lips for your chosen orientation.
- Do not block the bottom intake slots or top exhaust opening with adhesive pads, labels, or accessory mounts.

## Validation Checklist

When `openscad` is installed:

```sh
openscad --version
openscad -o /tmp/rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.off -D 'render_mode="assembly"' rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad
openscad -o /tmp/rpi5_ai_hat_tower.off -D 'render_mode="tower"' rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad
openscad -o /tmp/rpi5_ai_hat_camera_arm.off -D 'render_mode="camera_arm"' rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad
openscad -o /tmp/rpi5_ai_hat_camera_holder.off -D 'render_mode="camera_holder"' rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad
openscad -o /tmp/rpi5_ai_hat_printable_layout.off -D 'render_mode="printable_layout"' rpi5_ai_hat_dual_heatsink_vision_case.scad
git diff --check
```

Manual inspection:

- Side walls remain substantially open for cooler intake and exhaust airflow.
- Bottom intake slots are present and unobstructed.
- Top exhaust is substantially open above the AI cooler clearance volume.
- Camera holder sits forward of the top exhaust path.
- CSI ribbon channel and relief geometry avoid intentionally sharp bends or pinch points.
- Each printable part has a plausible flat print orientation.
- Adjustable variables are grouped and understandable without reading implementation modules.
